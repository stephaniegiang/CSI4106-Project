# CSI 4106 Final Project
Based off of the Kaggle competition:  
https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/  

Analyzing 3 algorithms:  
* Random Forest
* Decision Tree
* Gradient Boosting

For getting the best features for each algorithm, we created 3 seperate files:
* best_features_random_forest.py
* best_features_decision_tree.py
* best_features_gradient_boosting.py

For evaluating all v1 and v2 of the algorithms with the 3 different feature sets:
* evaluate_random_forest.py
* evaluate_decision_tree.py
* evaluate_gradient_boosting.py

For doing model tuning, we used both grid search and randomized search:
* grid_search_random_forest.py
* grid_search_decision_tree.py
* random_search_gradient_boosting.py
